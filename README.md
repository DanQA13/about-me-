# about-me-
<p>This webpage is designed for a user who would like to learn more about Daniel Cornier. In this project i used HTML 5 for my structure, CSS for my styling and javascript for my functionality. Some of the challenges I faced are that i am still learning to code and i am still unaware of some of the features of using these languages</p>

The user has access to information regarding DC (Daniel Cornier) including
- linkedin 
- Social media page
- and employment

The user will be asked a series of questions and all input from user is stored or used in responses using if or else if statements. 

The last set of questions I used an array along with a for loop with a nested for loop.
